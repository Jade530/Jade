𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

😅

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and your body never felt like this before

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
it shows that you really love me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
you can lie yes but your body cant

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and if you want to keep having this feeling

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
we shouldnt make you feel like that alot right now

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
( we shouldnt say sweet things to each other unless its important )

lily:
but...

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so we can have fun saying it when we are married


lily:
but...

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
there will be time when you really want to hear it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
when that happen tell me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i will say it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but other than that we shouldnt

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because the more you hear it the more you will get used to it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so we have to save it till we are married

lily:
i feel hot rn

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
yea its normal

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:Edited 
for me im always hot when im talking to you

lily:
yeah

lily:
but i feel like i wanna touch myself

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
let think of it this way

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you want to touch yourself and its haram

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
or want me to touch you when its halal?

lily:
omg that made more hot

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
oh fk my bad

lily:
dw

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ok keep that in mind

lily:
yeah

lily:
i want you to touch me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if you touched yourself you wont have fun when you do it with your husband

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and the more you do it the less you will feel with your husband

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so its back to you

lily:
why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
as i said

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
you will get used to that feeling

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so you will need more and more and more

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
the more you do it and more you will need it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and the less fun you will have

lily:
oh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so you will need more than normal to feel happy while doing it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so if you want to have no fun when you do it with your husband

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
you can touch yourself now

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
alone

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
it will feel good but not as good when you do it with your husband

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
you can touch yourself

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but i will keep mine

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i will save it for my wife

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so i can have as much fun with her as i can

lily:
yesh

lily:
but

lily:
do you want to touch me? after marriage ofc

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
1000% yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
when i touch you do you want to feel nothing or do you want to enjoy it?


lily:
but isn't it like eww?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
no men love women and women love men

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
samething here

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but you arent in right age

lily:
i am

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ok i will teach you somethings

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but promise me two things

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and if you didnt do as you promise i wont ever trust you again

lily:
okay


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
1. you wont search for how it looks like because its haram

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
.


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
2. you wont touch your body

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
.

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
promise me

lily:
i promise

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
as i said there is reasons why its haram

lily:
whu


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
1. you wont search for how it looks like because its haram

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because it will make you do the second thing that is touch your body


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
2. you wont touch your body

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because you wont have fun when you get married

lily:
ohh okok

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and that lead to divorce sometimes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if you want to ruin your future do it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so do you know how kids come?

lily:
no

lily:
kinda

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
alah made women with organ that shape inside there body

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and men organ shape outside their body

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so men can put their organ in women organ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and when that happen

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
something comes out from men and women organ that lead to baby's birth inside woman

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and the thing that comes out is liquid called sperm

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that sperm go inside women's organ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and women have eggs inside their body

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and sperm to go this egg and may lead to birth or no

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
one min i will go get some water and continue to you

lily:
okay

lily:
so i am a chicken?


lily:
so i am a chicken?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Noo

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Men and women have two eggs

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Inside their organ

lily:
so you're a chicken too?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Men eggs help creating the sperm


lily:
so you're a chicken too?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
😂😂nooo

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
It takes egg shape

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
That why we call it egg

lily:
ohhh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But its not real egg

lily:
okok


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Men eggs help creating the sperm

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And women egg take the sperm and lead to kid birth

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
The sperm is the kid

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And women egg take care of the sperm and if it may or may not lead to kid birth

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So does it make sense now why yours is inside your body and ours is outside?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And allah made us feel joy and happiness and fun while doing this

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Thats why you feel like you want to touch your organ and thats why our organ gets hard

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And you get wet so you can have fun

lily:
why i get wet?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So you dont get hurt

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Lets have example

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What happen if there is friction between your both hands?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
It will get hot

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Right?

lily:
what's friction?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Like put your hands together

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And move both so fast

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Up and down

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You will hand get hot

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Right?

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But if you put oil in your hands

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You wont feel hot

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You will feel taht you just move your hands

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Same thing to your organ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Your body do it automaticly

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Got it?

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
It will hurt both of us if you arent wet

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But when you are wet both of man and woman will have fun

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Alot of fun depends if you touched yourself before or no

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I want to be yours ok?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Lulu?

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Then we have to be serious

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Okay

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
We will be away from each other a bit of time

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Ok so put limits to anyone try to talk to you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Like if someone came and say a joke are you going to laugh if its good?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
As a muslim you shouldnt laugh

lily:
oh

lily:
why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because if you did it means that you dont mind that this man become closer to you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And there is nothing called frienda between man and woman

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because when a guy say that he is your friend he just will wait till you love him

lily:
oh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And i was straight up with you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I said that i want to marry you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But they wont

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
They will just try to get close to you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And do things without marriage and then leaves you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Some of them think this way

lily:
oh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And the good people will ask to marry you and im trying to be one of this good people

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So if someone came to you and tried to talk to you what will you do

lily:

lily:

lily:

lily:
i say "im not interested" and leave

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
1.

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
No matter how much we argue or how strong the argue is, we always should fix the argue before the day ends

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
2.

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
3.

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
If you are mad at me just tell me dont be afraid to argue with me but we should think of middle solution and end the argue before sleeping

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
4. Keep in mind that i dont hit people (use force) no matter how angry i am

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I hate using force to solve things

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if they think they still muslims then let them be

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
being muslims isnt by words

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its by actions

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if they dont pray they arent muslim

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i hate when people touch me without reason

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i dont think they will be able to touch me

lily:
why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and people here are muslims

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
they cant just touch me without reason

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
everyone will be disgusted of them if they did that to charm a man


lily:
why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i dont let anyone get close to me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and if they arent close they wont be able to touch me

lily:
but what if a non-muslim girl comes to you and she touches your shoulder to get attention and ask some informations?


lily:
but what if a non-muslim girl comes to you and she touches your shoulder to get attention and ask some informations?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if she came from my back so i dont see her and she touched my shoulder i will look at her and give her look that show her that im disgusted of her

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i wont even respond to her

lily:

lily:

lily:
okok

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i wont treat someone    bad because they compliments me

lily:
but what if you find someone better than me?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i will give them normal answer

lily:

lily:
but what if you find someone better than me?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
thats good one

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i will look what i have in my hand

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and not what i dont have

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because if i left you for her

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i will find someone more attractive than her

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and so on

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and at the end i wont get married

lily:
wait

lily:
i didn't understand

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so i choose to look at what i have in my hand and appreciate it


lily:
i didn't understand

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
which part?

lily:
nothing i understood

lily:
kinda

lily:
but i got what you mean

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i choose to appreciate you and not to go look for someone better

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because if i choose to look for someone better

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i wont stay with one girl

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i wont get married

lily:
yee

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i love you already

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i want you only

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you have any other question?😁


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you have any other question?😁

lily:
yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
go ahead

lily:
why does girls cover?

lily:
and not boys?


lily:
why does girls cover?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because girls are beautiful

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and they could cover so men dont get charmed by their look and because no one harm them because they are beautiful

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its to protect both genders

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and because what should we hide? our beard or our short hair(some of us are bald😂 )?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i didnt lie when i said you are the definition of beauty

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
does it make sense to you?

lily:
yeah

lily:
but you're very beautiful too


lily:
but you're very beautiful too

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but not as any woman

lily:
but you're very beautiful for women

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
you are 200% prettier than me


lily:
but you're very beautiful for women

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
good point

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
thats why we should try avoid being so charmful

lily:
that's not true at all

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but i didnt wear like that to look good i was going to beach thats why i had this clothes on


lily:
that's not true at all

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
what you mean?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
we should be beautiful and clean but if man wearing this things

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and look like this so he can charm a girl

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
then its haram


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
thats why we should try avoid being so charmful

lily:
how

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if he didnt mean to charm a girl and he wear like that to just look good in general then its normal


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if he didnt mean to charm a girl and he wear like that to just look good in general then its normal

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that answer your question "how"

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its about the reasons

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and at the end both of us shouldnt look at the opposite gender unless there is a reason

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i dont look at girls because of two reasons

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
first its haram

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
second we learned that if you did something bad or good to people

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that thing will happen to you one day

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and if i looked at woman in street

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
one day someone will look at my wife or sister or mother

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i wont like it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
at all

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
thats why im avoiding to look at women or girls in street or anywhere

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and im used to it by now

lily:
you're too pretty and charmful


lily:
you're too pretty and charmful

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Imagine me trying my best working so hard and trying to make you live comforable and all you do is being house wife

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What I'm trying to say

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You should read books

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
If you hate books

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Then learn how to improve your cook skills

lily:

lily:
ohh

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I want you to be my everything

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I don't want friends

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I jusr want wife who can be my everything

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
My friend my baby my wife my princess

lily:
i can

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Then is all what i want

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And look for improvment

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Being house wife just easy thing

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You have to be strong

lily:
i am strong

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But right now you almost strong enough

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But let me ask you question


lily:
i am strong

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Not enough yet to hold a house and husband and children and take care of yourself

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You can't do all this at same time right now

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But i believe that you will be able to do it when we get married


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But let me ask you question

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Don't you want our family to be happy

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Like our children

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You and me

lily:
i want

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Then you can't just say that you are enough

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You should say i will get better

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because lets say i did same thing as you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Wee won't have money to get apartment

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Where we will live

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And if you didn't change

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Our family well die

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Not die die

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But we will have alot of problems

lily:
okay im sorry

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I saw alot of family get destroyed

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Parents get divorced because of stupid stuff

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And children become depressed

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And some kill themselves

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I don't think you want any of that

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I know you just 15

lily:
mh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And you shouldn't know all this

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But i want you to know how reality work

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Being housewife isnt easy as you think

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Its as important as having place to live in

lily:
yee

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because bad housewife may lead to divorce and alot of bad things

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And same thing to me but I'm doing my best from now

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I'm learning how to treat your wife and how to act with teenagers

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because I'm the one who will take care of them when they are teenagers

lily:
yeahh

lily:
why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Before that kids want their mom not their dad


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Before that kids want their mom not their dad

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
. That's why

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Teenagers will have alot of questions

lily:
wdym

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Of their dad or mom didn't answer it they may go and try some bad things

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So leave that part to me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Anne before that they just want kindness

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
That doesn't mean that i won't play with them etc

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But they won't be as happy if you are the one playing with them

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You will see

lily:
okaay

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
They will love you more than me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Even if in treating them better than you

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Kids prefer their mom

It is Haram for a Muslim to exercise their sexual desires in any way other than what has been made Halal for them: their spouse, and whom their right hand possess. The latter is no longer relevant in our time, as slavery no longer exists. I hope this answers your question, and Allah knows best.

😐

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Is that hormones?😂

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I like it

lily:
??

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Keep going

lily:
wdym


lily:
??

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Do you know hormones?

lily:
no

lily:
ill go pray a sec

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Ok

lily:
you explain

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Ok

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Go i will explaib

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So male have 90%male hormones and 10% female hormones

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And female have 90% female hormones and 10% male hormones

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Male hormones

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Makes men strong and change their voices to deep
And making hair grow faster in face and leg and hands

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And make our muscles stronger

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And female hormones is the opposite

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Its makes your voice high pitch and make your body weaker than men and hair grow slower than men and your muscles is weaker

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Women should have some of male hormones because of they didn't they will be so weak if man touched her, her bones may break

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And men will be so strong if they didn't have female hormones

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So that why is 90% 10%

lily:
nice

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And your hormones changes at this age

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And it makes you confused

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Sometime happy and after one second you are crying without reasons

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And maybe you love this guy now and one min after you hate him

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So when you act crazy it's because of hormones

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You didn't know why you were crying for no reason all this time?

lily:
yee

lily:
but why is this complicated 😭😭

lily:
i was down with another friend

lily:
while someone was explaining something

lily:
so i opened brawl stars

lily:
and it was in arabic

lily:
then i saw a old lady that were wearing a brawl stars t-shirt

lily:
so i said to my friend "look at that old lady she has brawl stars t-shirt"

lily:
and my friend said "wow i wish i could play"

lily:
so i showed her my phone with the game opened

lily:
and i said "im on another lvl"

lily:
like I'm pro

lily:
so she took my phone and played with it

lily:
then i saw my brother and my father up in the church

lily:
so i went to them

lily:
but

lily:
there was a fucking group of pick me girls

lily:
that they stopped me

lily:
and they were letting see someone how to walk like a pick me girl

lily:
aaaaaa omg

lily:
it was annoying asf

😂1
lily:
so

lily:
i said that that's not the way girls walk

lily:
and she said then how they walk

lily:
and i let them see how a girl walks

lily:
and they were laughing

lily:
and making fun of the way i was walking

lily:Edited 
so i got mad

lily:
and grabbed her neck

lily:
and i dissed her

lily:
i don't remember the words

lily:
but it was a really good dissing

lily:
so they were acting all sad etc yk

lily:
so i finally get to my brother and father

lily:
but the priest he chased us away

lily:

lily:
so we left

lily:
but my father dissed him

lily:
so i went on my own way

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
first of all and its the most important thing

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
women shouldnt talk with men without reason
men shouldnt talk with women without reason too

lily:
ik

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if man want a girl he should go ask for her hand

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and not talk with her

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

ik

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
or even take care of myself

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i wont be able to handle a family

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
third

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
we shouldnt talk alot because we will get bored of each other

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
having alot of sugar everyday will harm your health

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and will make you get bored of sugar

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but having small amount of sugar from time to time is the right thing to do

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:
ye

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and what is different about this water that its pure too


lily:
im so fat

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
why would i care about what around the water?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
did the water choose what should be around her like grass or small trees or uneatable food?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
no

lily:Edited 
i wanna cry sm but i can't

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so why would i care if you are fat or no

lily:
i wanna cry sm but i can't

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
why

lily:
i have makeup on

lily:

lily:
so i wanted to let it see to my parents

lily:
but my father said its not that good

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:
and my mother slapped me and yelled at me saying that i was doing nothing for all day long and that i had to tidy my room asap

lily:
and she said that i won't eat today and not even tmw

lily:
so

lily:
that hurts really bad

lily:
ngl

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
good


lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
good job

lily:
hehe

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so lets learn words step by step but first do you know how to spell this letters?

lily:
wdym


lily:
ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ى

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you know the sound of each letter of this?

lily:
ohh yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
are you sure that you read it right?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
if yes then lets continue

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
there is some facts you should know


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
are you sure that you read it right?

lily:
yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
arabic is written from right to left unlike english

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and its same as Japanese

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you know the pronunciation of خ. ق. ع?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because this letter pronunciation doesnt in exist in most languages


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you know the pronunciation of خ. ق. ع?

lily:
yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
sure?

lily:
yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ok even so if you dont pronounce it  good enough its fine for now

lily:
okii

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
there is a letters that look a like, like ن، ب، ت، ث

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its same but dots is the difference

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
there is letter with one dot, two dots, three dots(the maximum) there is dot on top and one below the letter

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ج ح خ this have similar curved shape

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
but dots is the difference

lily:
yeahh

lily:
gosh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
everything fine?

lily:
yeah

lily:
but i get confused with similar letters

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its fine you will get used to it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and i will tell you how to practice it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
now lets make it harder

lily:
okay

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
د ذ ر ز (this is letters that don’t connect on the left)

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
lets try and mix them to see if thats true

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
تقذا

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
it didnt connect with ا

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
because if it did it will be other letter that is ن

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
تقنا


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
تقذا

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
here is ذ


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
تقنا

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and here is ن

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
same with دذرز

lily:
that's where i get confused

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
do you have questions

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that may help you be less confused

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
?

lily:
no dw

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ok

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
there is letters that kinda sounds the same

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
س ص ث

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
د ض

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ت ط

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ز ذ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
etc

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and you will know the difference the more you use it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
even some arabs is bad at these

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
i was writing مطوست instead of متوسط till i learned that i was wrong

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so dont ever be ashamed if you made mistakes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
every letter have different shape when they are connected (i think all look the same)

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
lets take ت as example

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
wait i love ب so lets take it instead

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
so

lily:
okay

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that what it looks like when you write (type) it alone

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ب

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that what it looks like when you write a letter after it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
بـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
that when you write it between two letters ـبـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and thats what it looks like when its the last letter in word (when letter before iit)

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـب

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
same with others except there is some letters that only have the first and last one


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ب

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
.


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـب

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
.

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
like د

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـد

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
when you put it between two letters that what you get

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـد ـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
not connected

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
take د as example for all letters thatt dont connect with letter after it

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and all is the same

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and with ب take all letters that can be connected

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
kinda two letters that have some difference

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ن ي

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and im kinda pretty sure only this two

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
and its not big deal

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
its just ن look different when its connected with letter after it and when its between two letters (same with ي)

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـنـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
نـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
يـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
ـيـ

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

Because that’s what I’m seeing right now

lily:
-_-

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
There is no other reason you would be talking to me right now except this

lily:
so now being friendly is liking someone?


lily:
so now being friendly is liking someone?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You aren’t being friendly

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You are being attached

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
There is difference

lily:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I may be wrong

lily:
exactly

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But if what you doing is being friendly then stop

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because we aren’t friends so don’t fake stuff

lily:
ah so you want me to be rude?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Being polite doesn’t have to do anything with being friendly

lily:
it's actually the same thing

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Nope friendly is how you act with friends polite it’s how you act with people who you respect for example

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And why I’m the only one in the world that you want to learn Arabic from

lily:
yeah but they mean the exactly same thing

lily:
it means to respect the other

lily:
bcs yes

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What you mean yes

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You sure you aren’t attached

lily:

lily:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Prove it then

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You know that I don’t want to talk to you?

lily:

lily:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Yes because I want to block you

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Good but let’s see where things go

lily:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
When you come to Egypt and get to know other people then you can tell me


lily:
okay so we just do our arabic lessons

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I don’t think that I will teach you well


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
When you come to Egypt and get to know other people then you can tell me

lily:
no i just know you, i don't want to know other boy people

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Can you be honest with me 
Do you have relatives in Egypt

lily:
yeah

lily:
i told you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You sure about leaving your family?

lily:
yeah

lily:
they treat me bad anyway

lily:
so

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You won’t miss them?

lily:
yeah im sure


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You won’t miss them?

lily:

lily:

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What about your relative

lily:
wdym

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You sure about living with them

lily:
yeah

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But what if they treated you bad

lily:
i have a single young aunty that she has a child so I'll live with her and i don't think she'll treat me bad since i can help her with the child


lily:
i have a single young aunty that she has a child so I'll live with her and i don't think she'll treat me bad since i can help her with the child

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Why don’t you ask her to find a guy for you that want to marry you

lily:
i already found one

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Look I don’t think I love you enough to say that this is the girl that I really want to marry

lily:
well you will

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Maybe because I didn’t see you in real life

lily:
also

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But what if I got married before you come

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What would you do

lily:
happens

lily:Edited 
i will stay by your side and if you ever need help i can help

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So you won’t get married?

lily:
i don't think so

lily:
no

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I’m happy to know that you love me that much but I don’t know if that what I want

lily:
you have time to find it out

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I gave to marry you to find out

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because I don’t think I will ever hangout with you without getting married

lily:
okay

lily:
when you want the marriage?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You know that i have to engage before we get married and your family should agree

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
If they didn’t we can’t get married

lily:
they already did agree

lily:
now we can marry

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
What did you tell them

lily:
if i can marry a guy

lily:
they said yes

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
OK so if that’s what you really want

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Then let’s wait to see what happens

lily:
yayyyy

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I won’t engage until 3 or 4 years from now

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
It’s enough time for you to decide what you want and if you really want that

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And to get used to Egypt

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Okay?

lily:
okay

lily:
that's perfect

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But at one condition

lily:
i will come to you in no time


𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
But at one condition

lily:
yes?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
We won’t talk until then

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Not at all

lily:
and the Arabic classes?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Just to tell each other infos


lily:
and the Arabic classes?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
I was doing it so I can block you after we’re done

lily:
why block?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And I don’t think that you chose me because I’m the best but because you wanted to open conversation


lily:
why block?

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because I didn’t want to talk to you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because I want to focus on my project

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You can learn online right? From YouTube and Google

lily:
mh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Don’t be sad

lily:
but I'll learn standard arabic there

lily:
idk if when i come they will actually understand me


lily:
but I'll learn standard arabic there

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
That will be enough

lily:
okay


lily:
idk if when i come they will actually understand me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Most of the time you will talk to your aunt

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Try to learn from her

lily:
okay

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You happy?

lily:

lily:
bcs i cannot talk to you at all until i come to you

lily:
just for infos


lily:
bcs i cannot talk to you at all until i come to you

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
You shouldn’t be sad

lily:
mh

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
Because I wasn’t even planning to keep you in my life so I won’t talk to you because if I did I won’t stop

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
And I won’t be able to focus on improving

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
So I won’t be able to make my future wife live comfortable

lily:
ik you already told me

𝑀𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑:
